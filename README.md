# One Transformer Can Understand Both 2D & 3D Molecular Data

This repository is the official implementation of ‚ÄúOne Transformer Can Understand Both 2D & 3D Molecular Data‚Äù, based on the official implementation of [Graphormer](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer) and [Fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq) in [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).

## Overview

![arch](docs/arch.jpg)

Transformer-M is a versatile and effective molecular model that can take molecular data of 2D or 3D formats as input and generate meaningful semantic representations. Using the standard Transformer as the backbone architecture, Transformer-M develops two separated channels to encode 2D and 3D structural information and incorporate them with the atom features in the network modules. When the input data is in a particular format, the corresponding channel will be activated, and the other will be disabled. Empirical results show that our Transformer-M can achieve strong performance on 2D and 3D tasks simultaneously, which is the first step toward general-purpose molecular models in chemistry.

üöÄ**Note:**  **PCQM4Mv2** is also the benchmark dataset of the graph-level track in the **2nd OGB-LSC** at [**NeurIPS 2022 competition track**](https://ogb.stanford.edu/neurips2022/). As non-participants, we open source all the codes and model weights, and sincerely welcome participants to use our model. Looking forward to your feedback!

```shell
# create paths to checkpoints for evaluation

# download the above model weights (L12.pt, L18.pt) to ./
mkdir -p logs/L12
mkdir -p logs/L18
mv L12.pt logs/L12/

## Datasets

- Preprocessed data: [download link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgZyC7AzHtDBeIDqE61u1ZEMv_8?e=3g428e)

  ```shell
  # create paths to datasets for evaluation/training
  
  # download the above compressed datasets (pcqm4mv2-pos.zip) to ./
  unzip pcqm4mv2-pos.zip -d ./datasets
  ```

- You can also directly execute the evaluation/training code to process data from scratch.

## Evaluation
